# HaShellS (Hajitsu Shell Scripts) ü•∑üèª
This repository was created to share my funny shell scripts. These scripts are created for handy and funny works like ssh, start or stop VPN, and so on...
<hr />

**First Step**

At first install `homebrew` using below command in Terminal app:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

then install `wget`:

    brew install wget
<hr />

**VPN Script**

To use [this](https://github.com/Hajitsu/hashells/blob/main/shells/vpn.sh) shell just go to file path and run `sh vpn.sh`. After that, you can connect or disconnect the selected VPN by `vpnstart` or `vpnstop`. To show the list of your VPNs just run `vpnutil list`.
